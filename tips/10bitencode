Use the 10-bit encoder. Not the 8-bit nor the 12-bit.
Optimally, use the slow preset. Veryslow preset is a luxury reserved for very powerful systems and high crf (22+) encodes.
	aq-mode=3!
This sets dark scene aq bias, which is really helpful for anime, as this is where most of the artifacts and banding will be.
Don't use tune animation. The appended options are :
	psy-rd=0.4:aq-strength=0.4:deblock=1,1:bframes=(preset+2).
These are optimized for cartoon-style animation, anything more complex than slice of life is going to suffer, especially with newer BD releases utilizing dynamic grain to prevent banding.
For "Anime" anime, I recommend psy-rd1 to 2 (more complex/action packed/detailed anime = higher value needed, also increases bitrate), aq-strength 0.6 to 1 (more complex/detailed = need higher value, don't go beyond 1 as you may introduce ringing artifacts.
You will mostly use 0.8-1. Also raises bitrate.), deblock -1:-1 to 1:1 (depends on source, leave on 0:0 if you don't know what to use) and bframes 4 to 8 (I highly recommend 6, 8 if possible.
Encode penalty is only ~5% going from 4 to 8). Additionally, if your source has grain, psy-rdoq should be raised from the default 1 to 3-5 depending on source (note: only combine higher rdoq with crf<18 and no-sao, or you'll end up with grain "blocks" instead of grain "grain").

Use limit-sao for crf 17-19.
Use no-sao for crf<18 if there are fine grain present. Else leave on default.
Use no-strong-intra-smoothing only for crf<16. This helps preserve fine details. High crf will result in blocking due to lack of smoothing on 32x32 blocks.

These are the most important stuff for Anime.

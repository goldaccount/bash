${parameter/pattern/string}
Pattern substitution.  
The pattern is expanded to produce a pattern just as in pathname expansion.  Parameter is expanded and the longest match of pattern  against  its value  is  replaced  with  string.   
If  pattern begins with /, all matches of pattern are replaced with string.  
Normally only the first match is replaced.  
If pattern begins with #, it must match at the beginning of the expanded value of parameter.  
If pattern begins with %, it must match at the end of the expanded value  of  parameter.   
If  string  is null, matches of pattern are deleted and the / following pattern may be omitted.  
If parameter is @ or *, the substitution operation is applied to each positional parameter in turn, and the expansion is the resultant list.  
If parameter is an array variable subscripted with @ or *, the  substitution  operation  is applied to each member of the array in turn, and the expansion is the resultant list.

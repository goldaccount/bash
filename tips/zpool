   Example 1: Creating a RAID-Z Storage Pool
           The following command creates a pool with a single raidz root vdev
           that consists of six disks:
                 # zpool create tank raidz sda sdb sdc sdd sde sdf

     Example 2: Creating a Mirrored Storage Pool
           The following command creates a pool with two mirrors, where each
           mirror contains two disks:
                 # zpool create tank mirror sda sdb mirror sdc sdd

     Example 3: Creating a ZFS Storage Pool by Using Partitions
           The following command creates an unmirrored pool using two disk
           partitions:
                 # zpool create tank sda1 sdb2

     Example 4: Creating a ZFS Storage Pool by Using Files
           The following command creates an unmirrored pool using files.
           While not recommended, a pool based on files can be useful for ex‐
           perimental purposes.
                 # zpool create tank /path/to/file/a /path/to/file/b

     Example 5: Adding a Mirror to a ZFS Storage Pool
           The following command adds two mirrored disks to the pool tank, as‐
           suming the pool is already made up of two-way mirrors.  The addi‐
           tional space is immediately available to any datasets within the
           pool.
                 # zpool add tank mirror sda sdb

     Example 6: Listing Available ZFS Storage Pools
           The following command lists all available pools on the system.  In
           this case, the pool zion is faulted due to a missing device.  The
           results from this command are similar to the following:
                 # zpool list
                 NAME    SIZE  ALLOC   FREE  EXPANDSZ   FRAG    CAP  DEDUP  HEALTH  ALTROOT
                 rpool  19.9G  8.43G  11.4G         -    33%    42%  1.00x  ONLINE  -
                 tank   61.5G  20.0G  41.5G         -    48%    32%  1.00x  ONLINE  -
                 zion       -      -      -         -      -      -      -  FAULTED -
     Example 7: Destroying a ZFS Storage Pool
           The following command destroys the pool tank and any datasets con‐
           tained within:
                 # zpool destroy -f tank

     Example 8: Exporting a ZFS Storage Pool
           The following command exports the devices in pool tank so that they
           can be relocated or later imported:
                 # zpool export tank

     Example 9: Importing a ZFS Storage Pool
           The following command displays available pools, and then imports
           the pool tank for use on the system.  The results from this command
           are similar to the following:
                 # zpool import
                   pool: tank
                     id: 15451357997522795478
                  state: ONLINE
                 action: The pool can be imported using its name or numeric identifier.
                 config:

                         tank        ONLINE
                           mirror    ONLINE
                             sda     ONLINE
                             sdb     ONLINE

                 # zpool import tank

     Example 10: Upgrading All ZFS Storage Pools to the Current Version
           The following command upgrades all ZFS Storage pools to the current
           version of the software:
                 # zpool upgrade -a
                 This system is currently running ZFS version 2.
    Example 11: Managing Hot Spares
           The following command creates a new pool with an available hot
           spare:
                 # zpool create tank mirror sda sdb spare sdc

           If one of the disks were to fail, the pool would be reduced to the
           degraded state.  The failed device can be replaced using the fol‐
           lowing command:
                 # zpool replace tank sda sdd

           Once the data has been resilvered, the spare is automatically re‐
           moved and is made available for use should another device fail.
           The hot spare can be permanently removed from the pool using the
           following command:
                 # zpool remove tank sdc

     Example 12: Creating a ZFS Pool with Mirrored Separate Intent Logs
           The following command creates a ZFS storage pool consisting of two,
           two-way mirrors and mirrored log devices:
                 # zpool create pool mirror sda sdb mirror sdc sdd log mirror
                 sde sdf

     Example 13: Adding Cache Devices to a ZFS Pool
           The following command adds two disks for use as cache devices to a
           ZFS storage pool:
                 # zpool add pool cache sdc sdd

           Once added, the cache devices gradually fill with content from main
           memory.  Depending on the size of your cache devices, it could take
           over an hour for them to fill.  Capacity and reads can be monitored
           using the iostat subcommand as follows:
                 # zpool iostat -v pool 5

     Example 14: Removing a Mirrored top-level (Log or Data) Device
           The following commands remove the mirrored log device mirror-2 and
           mirrored top-level data device mirror-1.
     Example 15: Displaying expanded space on a device
           The following command displays the detailed information for the
           pool data.  This pool is comprised of a single raidz vdev where one
           of its devices increased its capacity by 10GB.  In this example,
           the pool will not be able to utilize this extra capacity until all
           the devices under the raidz vdev have been expanded.
                 # zpool list -v data
                 NAME         SIZE  ALLOC   FREE  EXPANDSZ   FRAG    CAP  DEDUP  HEALTH  ALTROOT
                 data        23.9G  14.6G  9.30G         -    48%    61%  1.00x  ONLINE  -
                   raidz1    23.9G  14.6G  9.30G         -    48%
                     sda         -      -      -         -      -
                     sdb         -      -      -       10G      -
                     sdc         -      -      -         -      -

     Example 16: Adding output columns
           Additional columns can be added to the zpool status and zpool
           iostat output with -c.
                 # zpool status -c vendor,model,size
                    NAME     STATE  READ WRITE CKSUM vendor  model        size
                    tank     ONLINE 0    0     0
